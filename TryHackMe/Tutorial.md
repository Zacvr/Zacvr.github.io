This will be quite simple as far as rooms go
<br/>
We just need to click the "Start AttackBox" and let it load (~2-5 minutes)
<br/>
Then once the "AttackBox" is loaded I had to click on the activate attack box button
<br/>
It made me wait 90 seconds to show the IP I needed
<br/>
For me it was "10.10.198.160" but yours may be different
<br/>
We then go into the "AttackBox" and paste that IP to see a cool page
<br/>
It has a flag!
<br/>
"flag{connection_verified}" is the flag
<br/>
Now we can click completed after reading their offerings and the room is done!
