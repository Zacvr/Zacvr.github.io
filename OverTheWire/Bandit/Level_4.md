Level 4 Fight!
<br/><br/>
In order to begin you will need to use PuTTY or preferably Linux and use the following information
<br/><br/>
If you are currently in a level type "logout"
<br/><br/>
Now type "ssh bandit4@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220"
<br/>
Password:"pIwrPrtPN36QITSp3EQaw936yaFoFgAB"
<br/>
We are now into level 4
<br/><br/>
For this level we are told
<br/><br/>
"The password for the next level is stored in the only human-readable file in the inhere directory. Tip: if your terminal is messed up, try the “reset” command."
<br/><br/>
If you have done this before you will know you can use
<br/><br/>
"ls " to show files/folders
<br/><br/>
If we then "cd inhere"
<br/><br/>
To find the password we will
<br/><br/>
"cat "./-file07" to read the file
<br/><br/>
we will find the password
<br/><br/>
"koReBOKuIDDepwhWk7jZC0RTdopnAYKh"
<br/><br/>
Once again we can use
<br/>
"ssh bandit5@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220"
<br/>
and the password we just found to login to the next level
<br/><br/>
