Level 1 Fight!


In order to begin you will need to use PuTTY or preferably Linux and use the following information

SSH Info
Host: bandit.labs.overthewire.org
Port: 2220

Username:bandit0 
Password:bandit0

I use this specific line to type in each level "ssh bandit0@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220" and just change the 0 for the level you want to type the password to
Then use the password:bandit0


If you us "ls" you will see a file named "readme"
If you use "cat readme" you will get the password "boJ9jbbUNNfktd78OOpsqOltutMc3MY1"

then you can type in

ssh bandit1@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220
and the password we just found to login to the next level
