<br/>

Level 2 Fight!
<br/><br/>
In order to begin you will need to use PuTTY or preferably Linux and use the following information
<br/><br/>
If you are currently in a level type "logout"
<br/><br/>
Now type "ssh bandit2@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220"
<br/>
Password:"CV1DtqXWVFXTvM2F0k09SHz0YwRINYA9"
<br/>
We are now into level 2
<br/><br/>
For this level we are told
<br/><br/>
"The password for the next level is stored in a file called spaces in this filename located in the home directory"
<br/><br/>
If you have done this before you will know you can use
<br/><br/>
"'cat space'" (Keeping one pair of single or double qoutes around the file)
<br/><br/>
to read this file which will give us the password
<br/><br/>
"UmHadQclWmgdLOKQ3YNgjWxGoRMb5luK"
<br/><br/>
Once again we can use
<br/>
"ssh bandit3@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220"
and the password we just found to login to the next level
<br/>
